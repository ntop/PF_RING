Important Notes
---------------

Disable LRO if enabling ip forwarding or bridging
-------------------------------------------------

WARNING: The ixgbe driver supports the Large Receive Offload (LRO) feature.
This option offers the lowest CPU utilization for receives but is completely
incompatible with *routing/ip forwarding* and *bridging*. If enabling ip
forwarding or bridging is a requirement, it is necessary to disable LRO using
compile time options as noted in the LRO section later in this document. The
result of not disabling LRO when combined with ip forwarding or bridging can be
low throughput or even a kernel panic.


Do not unload port driver if VF with active VM is bound to it
-------------------------------------------------------------

Do not unload a port's driver if a Virtual Function (VF) with an active Virtual
Machine (VM) is bound to it. Doing so will cause the port to appear to hang.
Once the VM shuts down, or otherwise releases the VF, the command will complete.


Configuring SR-IOV for improved network security
------------------------------------------------

In a virtualized environment, on Intel(R) Server Adapters that support SR-IOV,
the virtual function (VF) may be subject to malicious behavior. Software-
generated layer two frames, like IEEE 802.3x (link flow control), IEEE 802.1Qbb
(priority based flow-control), and others of this type, are not expected and
can throttle traffic between the host and the virtual switch, reducing
performance. To resolve this issue, configure all SR-IOV enabled ports for
VLAN tagging. This configuration allows unexpected, and potentially malicious,
frames to be dropped.



Overview
--------

This driver supports kernel versions 2.6.x and newer.

It supports all Linux systems (Itanium(R)2, x86_64, i686, and PPC).

Driver information can be obtained using ethtool, lspci, and ifconfig.
Instructions on updating ethtool can be found in the section Additional
Configurations later in this document.

This driver is only supported as a loadable module at this time. Intel is
not supplying patches against the kernel source to allow for static linking of
the drivers.

For questions related to hardware requirements, refer to the documentation
supplied with your Intel adapter. All hardware requirements listed apply to
use with Linux.

The following features are now available in supported kernels:
- Native VLANs
- Channel Bonding (teaming)
- SNMP

Adapter teaming is implemented using the native Linux Channel bonding
module. This is included in supported Linux kernels.

Channel Bonding documentation can be found in the Linux kernel source:
/documentation/networking/bonding.txt

The driver information previously displayed in the /proc file system is not
supported in this release.



NOTE: Devices based on the Intel(R) Ethernet Connection X552 and Intel(R) Ethernet
Connection X553 do not support the following features:
* Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE)
* Intel PROSet for Windows Device Manager
* Intel ANS teams or VLANs (LBFO is supported)
* Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE)
* Data Center Bridging (DCB)
* IPSec Offloading
* MACSec Offloading
In addition, SFP+ devices based on the Intel(R) Ethernet Connection X552 and Intel(R) Ethernet
Connection X553 do not support the following features:
* Speed and duplex auto-negotiation.
* Wake on LAN
* 1000BASE-T SFP Modules


Identifying Your Adapter
------------------------
The driver in this release is compatible with devices based on the following:
  * Intel(R) Ethernet Controller 82598
  * Intel(R) Ethernet Controller 82599
  * Intel(R) Ethernet Controller X540
  * Intel(R) Ethernet Controller x550
  * Intel(R) Ethernet Controller X552

================================================================================


Building and Installation
-------------------------

To build a binary RPM* package of this driver, run 'rpmbuild -tb
ixgbe-<x.x.x>.tar.gz', where <x.x.x> is the version number for the driver tar file.

NOTES:

- For the build to work properly, the currently running kernel MUST match
  the version and configuration of the installed kernel sources. If you have
  just recompiled the kernel reboot the system before building.
- RPM functionality has only been tested in Red Hat distributions.

1. Move the base driver tar file to the directory of your choice. For
   example, use '/home/username/ixgbe' or '/usr/local/src/ixgbe'.

2. Untar/unzip the archive, where <x.x.x> is the version number for the
   driver tar file:
   tar zxf ixgbe-<x.x.x>.tar.gz

3. Change to the driver src directory, where <x.x.x> is the version number
   for the driver tar:
   cd ixgbe-<x.x.x>/src/

4. Compile the driver module:
   # make install
   The binary will be installed as:
   /lib/modules/<KERNEL VERSION>/updates/drivers/net/ethernet/intel/ixgbe/ixgbe.ko

   The install location listed above is the default location. This may differ
   for various Linux distributions.

5. Load the module using the modprobe command:
   modprobe <ixgbe> [parameter=port1_value,port2_value]

   Make sure that any older ixgbe drivers are removed from the kernel before
   loading the new module:
   rmmod ixgbe; modprobe ixgbe

6. Assign an IP address to the interface by entering the following,
   where ethX is the interface name that was shown in dmesg after modprobe:
   
   ip address add <IP_address>/<netmask bits> dev ethX

7. Verify that the interface works. Enter the following, where IP_address
   is the IP address for another machine on the same subnet as the interface
   that is being tested:
   ping <IP_address>

NOTE:
   For certain distributions like (but not limited to) RedHat Enterprise
   Linux 7 and Ubuntu, once the driver is installed the initrd/initramfs
   file may need to be updated to prevent the OS loading old versions
   of the ixgbe driver. The dracut utility may be used on RedHat
   distributions:
	# dracut --force
   For Ubuntu:
	# update-initramfs -u


================================================================================


Command Line Parameters
-----------------------
If the driver is built as a module, the following optional parameters are used
by entering them on the command line with the modprobe command using this
syntax:
modprobe ixgbe [<option>=<VAL1>,<VAL2>,...]

There needs to be a <VAL#> for each network port in the system supported by
this driver. The values will be applied to each instance, in function order.
For example:
modprobe ixgbe InterruptThrottleRate=16000,16000

In this case, there are two network ports supported by ixgbe in the system.
The default value for each parameter is generally the recommended setting,
unless otherwise noted.

NOTES:
- For more information about the command line parameters, see the application
  note at: http://www.intel.com/design/network/applnots/ap450.htm.
- A descriptor describes a data buffer and attributes related to the data
  buffer. This information is accessed by the hardware.


RSS
---
Valid Range: 0-16
0 = Assign up to the lesser value of the number of CPUs or the number of queues
X = Assign X queues, where X is less than or equal to the maximum number of
queues (16 queues). 
RSS also effects the number of transmit queues allocated on 2.6.23 and
newer kernels with CONFIG_NETDEVICES_MULTIQUEUE set in the kernel .config file.
CONFIG_NETDEVICES_MULTIQUEUE only exists from 2.6.23 to 2.6.26. Other options
enable multiqueue in 2.6.27 and newer kernels.


Multiqueue
----------
Valid Range:
0, 1
0 = Disables Multiple Queue support
1 = Enabled Multiple Queue support (a prerequisite for RSS)


Direct Cache Access (DCA)
-------------------------
Valid Range: 0, 1
0 = Disables DCA support in the driver
1 = Enables DCA support in the driver
If the driver is enabled for DCA, this parameter allows load-time control of
the feature.
Note: DCA is not supported on X550-based adapters.


IntMode
-------
Valid Range: 0-2 (0 = Legacy Int, 1 = MSI and 2 = MSI-X)
IntMode controls allow load time control over the type of interrupt
registered for by the driver. MSI-X is required for multiple queue
support, and some kernels and combinations of kernel .config options
will force a lower level of interrupt support.
'cat /proc/interrupts' will show different values for each type of interrupt.


InterruptThrottleRate
---------------------
Valid Range:
0=off
1=dynamic
<min_ITR>-<max_ITR>
Interrupt Throttle Rate controls the number of interrupts each interrupt
vector can generate per second. Increasing ITR lowers latency at the cost of
increased CPU utilization, though it may help throughput in some circumstances.
0 = Setting InterruptThrottleRate to 0 turns off any interrupt moderation
  and may improve small packet latency. However, this is generally not
  suitable for bulk throughput traffic due to the increased CPU utilization
  of the higher interrupt rate.
  NOTES:
  - On 82599, and X540, and X550-based adapters, disabling InterruptThrottleRate
    will also result in the driver disabling HW RSC.
  - On 82598-based adapters, disabling InterruptThrottleRate will also
    result in disabling LRO (Large Receive Offloads).
1 = Setting InterruptThrottleRate to Dynamic mode attempts to moderate
  interrupts per vector while maintaining very low latency. This can
  sometimes cause extra CPU utilization. If planning on deploying ixgbe
  in a latency sensitive environment, this parameter should be considered.
<min_ITR>-<max_ITR> = 956-488281
  Setting InterruptThrottleRate to a value greater or equal to <min_ITR>
  will program the adapter to send at most that many interrupts
  per second, even if more packets have come in. This reduces interrupt load
  on the system and can lower CPU utilization under heavy load, but will
  increase latency as packets are not processed as quickly.



LLI (Low Latency Interrupts)
----------------------------

LLI allows for immediate generation of an interrupt upon processing receive
packets that match certain criteria as set by the parameters described below.
LLI parameters are not enabled when Legacy interrupts are used. You must be
using MSI or MSI-X (see cat /proc/interrupts) to successfully use LLI.

Note: LLI is not supported on X550-based adapters.



LLIPort
-------
Valid Range: 0-65535
LLI is configured with the LLIPort command-line parameter, which specifies
which TCP port should generate Low Latency Interrupts.
For example, using LLIPort=80 would cause the board to generate an immediate
interrupt upon receipt of any packet sent to TCP port 80 on the local machine.
WARNING: Enabling LLI can result in an excessive number of interrupts/second
that may cause problems with the system and in some cases may cause a kernel
panic.

Note: LLI is not supported on X550-based adapters.



LLIPush
-------
Valid Range: 0-1
LLIPush can be set to be enabled or disabled (default). It is most effective
in an environment with many small transactions.
NOTE: Enabling LLIPush may allow a denial of service attack.

Note: LLI is not supported on X550-based adapters.



LLISize
-------
Valid Range: 0-1500
LLISize causes an immediate interrupt if the board receives a packet smaller
than the specified size.

Note: LLI is not supported on X550-based adapters.



LLIEType
--------
Valid Range: 0-0x8FFF
This parameter specifies the Low Latency Interrupt (LLI) Ethernet protocol type.

Note: LLI is not supported on X550-based adapters.



LLIVLANP
--------

Valid Range: 0-7

This parameter specifies the LLI on VLAN priority threshold.

Note: LLI is not supported on X550-based adapters.



Flow Control
------------

Ethernet Flow Control (IEEE 802.3x) can be configured with ethtool to enable
receiving and transmitting pause frames for ixgbe. When transmit is enabled,
pause frames are generated when the receive packet buffer crosses a predefined
threshold. When receive is enabled, the transmit unit will halt for the time
delay specified when a pause frame is received. 

Flow Control is enabled by default.

Use ethtool to change the flow control settings.

ethtool:
ethtool -A eth? autoneg off rx off tx off




NOTE: For 82598 backplane cards entering 1 gigabit mode, flow control default
behavior is changed to off. Flow control in 1 gigabit mode on these devices
can lead to transmit hangs.


NOTE: You must have a flow control capable link partner.




Intel(R) Ethernet Flow Director
-------------------------------
NOTE: Flow director parameters are only supported on kernel versions 2.6.30 or
newer.

The Flow Director performs the following tasks:

  - Directs receive packets according to their flows to different queues.
  - Enables tight control on routing a flow in the platform.
  - Matches flows and CPU cores for flow affinity.
  - Supports multiple parameters for flexible flow classification and load
    balancing (in SFP mode only).

NOTES:

  - An included script (set_irq_affinity) automates setting the IRQ to
    CPU affinity.
  - Flow director masking works in the opposite manner from subnet masking. In
    the following command:
	#ethtool -N eth11 flow-type ip4 src-ip 172.4.1.2 m 255.0.0.0 dst-ip \
	172.21.1.1 m 255.128.0.0 action 31
    The src-ip value that is written to the filter will be 0.4.1.2, not
    172.0.0.0 as might be expected. Similarly, the dst-ip value written to the
    filter will be 0.21.1.1, not 172.0.0.0.

ethtool commands:

  - To enable or disable the Flow Director:

	# ethtool -K ethX ntuple <on|off>

	When disabling ntuple filters, all the user programed filters are
	flushed from the driver cache and hardware. All needed filters must
	be re-added when ntuple is re-enabled.

  - To add a filter that directs packet to queue 2, use -U or -N switch:

	# ethtool -N ethX flow-type tcp4 src-ip 192.168.10.1 dst-ip \
	192.168.10.2 src-port 2000 dst-port 2001 action 2 [loc 1]

  - To see the list of filters currently present:
	# ethtool <-u|-n> ethX


Perfect Filter
--------------

Perfect filter is an interface to load the filter table that funnels all flow
into queue_0 unless an alternative queue is specified using "action". In that
case, any flow that matches the filter criteria will be directed to the
appropriate queue.

Support for Virtual Function (VF) is through the user data field. ethtool must
be updated to the version built for the 2.6.40 kernel. Perfect Filter is
supported on all kernels 2.6.30 and later. Rules may be deleted from the table
itself. This is done using "ethtool -U ethX delete N", where N is the rule
number to be deleted.

NOTE: Flow Director Perfect Filters can run in single queue mode when SR-IOV
is enabled or when DCB is enabled.

If the queue is defined as -1, the filter will drop matching packets.

To account for filter matches and misses, there are two stats in ethtool:
fdir_match and fdir_miss. In addition, rx_queue_N_packets shows the number of
packets processed by the Nth queue.

NOTES:
- Receive Packet Steering (RPS) and Receive Flow Steering (RFS) are not
  compatible with Flow Director. If Flow Director is enabled, these will be
  disabled
- For VLAN Masks only four masks are supported.
- Once a rule is defined, you must supply the same fields and masks (if
  masks are specified).


Support for UDP RSS
-------------------

This feature adds an ON/OFF switch for hashing over certain flow types. Only
UDP can be turned on. The default setting is disabled.

Only support for enabling/disabling hashing on ports for UDP over IPv4 (UDP4) or
IPv6 (UDP6) is supported.

NOTE: Fragmented packets may arrive out of order when RSS UDP support is
configured.

Supported Ethtool Commands and Options:
  -n --show-nfc
    Retrieves the receive network flow classification configurations.
  rx-flow-hash tcp4|udp4|ah4|esp4|sctp4|tcp6|udp6|ah6|esp6|sctp6
    Retrieves the hash options for the specified network traffic type.
  -N --config-nfc
    Configures the receive network flow classification.
  rx-flow-hash tcp4|udp4|ah4|esp4|sctp4|tcp6|udp6|ah6|esp6|sctp6
  m|v|t|s|d|f|n|r...
    Configures the hash options for the specified network traffic type.
	udp4	UDP over IPv4
	udp6	UDP over IPv6
	f	Hash on bytes 0 and 1 of the Layer 4 header of the rx packet.
	n	Hash on bytes 2 and 3 of the Layer 4 header of the rx packet.

The following is an example using udp4 (UDP over IPv4):
  - To include UDP port numbers in RSS hashing run:
    ethtool -N ethX rx-flow-hash udp4 sdfn

  - To exclude UDP port numbers from RSS hashing run:
    ethtool -N ethX rx-flow-hash udp4 sd

  - To display UDP hashing current configuration run:
    ethtool -n ethX rx-flow-hash udp4

The results of running that call will be the following, if UDP hashing is
enabled.

  UDP over IPV4 flows use these fields for computing Hash flow key:
    IP SA
    IP DA
    L4 bytes 0 & 1 [TCP/UDP src port]
    L4 bytes 2 & 3 [TCP/UDP dst port]

The results if UDP hashing is disabled are shown below.
  UDP over IPV4 flows use these fields for computing Hash flow key:
    IP SA
    IP DA

Parameters FdirPballoc and AtrSampleRate impact Flow Director.


FdirPballoc
-----------
Valid Range: 1-3
Specifies the Flow Director allocated packet buffer size.
1 = 64k
2 = 128k
3 = 256k


AtrSampleRate
-------------
Valid Range: 0-255
This parameter is used with the Flow Director and is the software ATR transmit
packet sample rate. For example, when AtrSampleRate is set to 20, every 20th
packet looks to see if the packet will create a new flow. A value of 0
indicates that ATR should be disabled and no samples will be taken.


max_vfs
-------
This parameter adds support for SR-IOV. It causes the driver to spawn up to
max_vfs worth of virtual functions.
Valid Range: 1-63
If the value is greater than 0 it will also force the VMDq parameter to be 1
or more.


NOTE: This parameter is only used on kernel 3.7.x and below. On kernel 3.8.x
and above, use sysfs to enable VFs. For example:
#echo $num_vf_enabled > /sys/class/net/$dev/device/sriov_numvfs	//enable VFs
#echo 0 > /sys/class/net/$dev/device/sriov_numvfs	//disable VFs


The parameters for the driver are referenced by position. Thus, if you have a
dual port adapter, or more than one adapter in your system, and want N virtual
functions per port, you must specify a number for each port with each parameter
separated by a comma. For example:

  modprobe ixgbe max_vfs=4

This will spawn 4 VFs on the first port.

  modprobe ixgbe max_vfs=2,4

This will spawn 2 VFs on the first port and 4 VFs on the second port.

NOTE: Caution must be used in loading the driver with these parameters.
Depending on your system configuration, number of slots, etc., it is impossible
to predict in all cases where the positions would be on the command line.

NOTE: Neither the device nor the driver control how VFs are mapped into config
space. Bus layout will vary by operating system. On operating systems that
support it, you can check sysfs to find the mapping. 


NOTE: When either SR-IOV mode or VMDq mode is enabled, hardware VLAN
filtering and VLAN tag stripping/insertion will remain enabled. Please remove
the old VLAN filter before the new VLAN filter is added. For example,
ip link set eth0 vf 0 vlan 100	// set vlan 100 for VF 0
ip link set eth0 vf 0 vlan 0	// Delete vlan 100
ip link set eth0 vf 0 vlan 200	// set a new vlan 200 for VF 0


With kernel 3.6, the driver supports the simultaneous usage of max_vfs and DCB
features, subject to the constraints described below. Prior to kernel 3.6, the
driver did not support the simultaneous operation of max_vfs greater than 0
and the DCB features (multiple traffic classes utilizing Priority Flow Control
and Extended Transmission Selection).

When DCB is enabled, network traffic is transmitted and received through
multiple traffic classes (packet buffers in the NIC). The traffic is
associated with a specific class based on priority, which has a value of 0
through 7 used in the VLAN tag. When SR-IOV is not enabled, each traffic class
is associated with a set of receive/transmit descriptor queue pairs. The
number of queue pairs for a given traffic class depends on the hardware
configuration. When SR-IOV is enabled, the descriptor queue pairs are grouped
into pools. The Physical Function (PF) and each Virtual Function (VF) is
allocated a pool of receive/transmit descriptor queue pairs. When multiple
traffic classes are configured (for example, DCB is enabled), each pool
contains a queue pair from each traffic class. When a single traffic class is
configured in the hardware, the pools contain multiple queue pairs from the
single traffic class.

The number of VFs that can be allocated depends on the number of traffic
classes that can be enabled. The configurable number of traffic classes for
each enabled VF is as follows:
0 - 15 VFs = Up to 8 traffic classes, depending on device support
16 - 31 VFs = Up to 4 traffic classes
32 - 63 VFs = 1 traffic class

When VFs are configured, the PF is allocated one pool as well. The PF supports
the DCB features with the constraint that each traffic class will only use a
single queue pair. When zero VFs are configured, the PF can support multiple
queue pairs per traffic class.


Configuring SR-IOV for improved network security
------------------------------------------------

In a virtualized environment, on Intel(R) Server Adapters that support SR-IOV,
the virtual function (VF) may be subject to malicious behavior. Software-
generated layer two frames, like IEEE 802.3x (link flow control), IEEE 802.1Qbb
(priority based flow-control), and others of this type, are not expected and
can throttle traffic between the host and the virtual switch, reducing
performance. To resolve this issue, configure all SR-IOV enabled ports for
VLAN tagging. This configuration allows unexpected, and potentially malicious,
frames to be dropped.


Configuring VLAN tagging on SR-IOV enabled adapter ports
--------------------------------------------------------

To configure VLAN tagging for the ports on an SR-IOV enabled adapter,
use the following command. The VLAN configuration should be done 
before the VF driver is loaded or the VM is booted.

$ ip link set dev <PF netdev id> vf <id> vlan <vlan id>

For example, the following instructions will configure PF eth0 and 
the first VF on VLAN 10.
$ ip link set dev eth0 vf 0 vlan 10
.

L2LBen
------
Valid Range: 0 (disabled), 1 (enabled)
This parameter controls the internal switch (L2 loopback between pf and vf).
By default the switch is enabled.


LRO
---
Valid Range: 0(off), 1(on)
Large Receive Offload (LRO) is a technique for increasing inbound throughput
of high-bandwidth network connections by reducing CPU overhead. It works by
aggregating multiple incoming packets from a single stream into a larger
buffer before they are passed higher up the networking stack, thus reducing
the number of packets that have to be processed. LRO combines multiple
Ethernet frames into a single receive in the stack, thereby potentially
decreasing CPU utilization for receives.
This technique is also referred to as Hardware Receive Side Coalescing
(HW RSC). 82599 and X540, and X550-based adapters support HW RSC. The
LRO parameter controls HW RSC enablement.
You can verify that the driver is using LRO by looking at these counters in
ethtool:
- hw_rsc_aggregated - counts total packets that were combined
- hw_rsc_flushed - counts the number of packets flushed out of LRO
NOTE: IPv6 and UDP are not supported by LRO.


EEE
---
Valid Range: 0-1
0 = Disables EEE
1 = Enables EEE
A link between two EEE-compliant devices will result in periodic bursts of
data followed by periods where the link is in an idle state. This Low Power
Idle (LPI) state is supported in both 1 Gbps and 10 Gbps link speeds.

NOTES: EEE support requires auto-negotiation.
  Both link partners must support EEE.
  EEE is not supported on all Intel(R) Ethernet Network devices or at all link speeds.



DMAC
----
Valid Range: 0, 41-10000
This parameter enables or disables DMA Coalescing feature. Values are in
microseconds and set the internal DMA Coalescing internal timer.
DMAC is available on Intel(R) X550 (and later) based adapters.
DMA (Direct Memory Access) allows the network device to move packet data
directly to the system's memory, reducing CPU utilization. However, the
frequency and random intervals at which packets arrive do not allow the
system to enter a lower power state. DMA Coalescing allows the adapter
to collect packets before it initiates a DMA event. This may increase
network latency but also increases the chances that the system will enter
a lower power state.
Turning on DMA Coalescing may save energy with kernel 2.6.32 and newer.
DMA Coalescing must be enabled across all active ports in order to save
platform power.
InterruptThrottleRate (ITR) should be set to dynamic. When ITR=0, DMA
Coalescing is automatically disabled.
A whitepaper containing information on how to best configure your platform is
available on the Intel website.


MDD (Malicious Driver Detection)
--------------------------------
Valid Range: 0-1
0 = Disabled
1 = Enabled
This parameter is only relevant for devices operating in SR-IOV mode.
When this parameter is set, the driver detects malicious VF driver and
disables its Tx/Rx queues until a VF driver reset occurs.


AQRate
------

Devices that support AQRate (X550 and later)?will include 2.5 Gbps and 
5 Gbps in the speeds that the driver advertises during auto-negotiation,
even though ethtool will not display 2.5 Gbps or 5 Gbps as "Supported link
modes" or "Advertised link modes." These speeds are only available through
unmodified auto-negotiation. You cannot use ethtool -s advertise to force
auto-negotiation to advertise 2.5 Gbps or 5 Gbps. If a 2.5 Gbps or 5 Gbps
link is created, ethtool will report the correct link speed.


================================================================================


Additional Features and Configurations
-------------------------------------------


Configuring the Driver on Different Distributions
-------------------------------------------------

Configuring a network driver to load properly when the system is started is
distribution dependent. Typically, the configuration process involves adding
an alias line to /etc/modules.conf or /etc/modprobe.conf as well as editing
other system startup scripts and/or configuration files. Many popular Linux
distributions ship with tools to make these changes for you. To learn the
proper way to configure a network device for your system, refer to your
distribution documentation. If during this process you are asked for the
driver or module name, the name for the Base Driver is ixgbe.

For example, if you install the ixgbe driver for two adapters (eth0
and eth1) and want to set the interrupt mode to MSI-X and MSI, respectively,
add the following to modules.conf or /etc/modprobe.conf:
alias eth0 ixgbe
alias eth1 ixgbe
options ixgbe InterruptThrottleRate=3,1


Viewing Link Messages
---------------------

Link messages will not be displayed to the console if the distribution is
restricting system messages. In order to see network driver link messages on
your console, set dmesg to eight by entering the following:
dmesg -n 8

NOTE: This setting is not saved across reboots.


Jumbo Frames
------------
Jumbo Frames support is enabled by changing the Maximum Transmission Unit
(MTU) to a value larger than the default value of 1500.

Use the ifconfig command to increase the MTU size. For example, enter the
following where <x> is the interface number:

   ifconfig eth<x> mtu 9000 up

NOTES:
- The maximum MTU setting for Jumbo Frames is 9710. This value coincides
  with the maximum Jumbo Frames size of 9728 bytes.
- This driver will attempt to use multiple page sized buffers to receive
  each jumbo packet. This should help to avoid buffer starvation issues
  when allocating receive packets.

- For 82599-based network connections, if you are enabling jumbo frames in a
  virtual function (VF), jumbo frames must first be enabled in the physical
  function (PF). The VF MTU setting cannot be larger than the PF MTU.



ethtool
-------
The driver utilizes the ethtool interface for driver configuration and
diagnostics, as well as displaying statistical information. The latest
ethtool version is required for this functionality. Download it at
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/software/network/ethtool/


Speed and Duplex Configuration
------------------------------

In addressing speed and duplex configuration issues, you need to
distinguish between copper-based adapters and fiber-based adapters.

In the default mode, an Intel(R) Network Adapter using copper connections
will attempt to auto-negotiate with its link partner to determine the best
setting. If the adapter cannot establish link with the link partner using
auto-negotiation, you may need to manually configure the adapter and link
partner to identical settings to establish link and pass packets. This
should only be needed when attempting to link with an older switch that
does not support auto-negotiation or one that has been forced to a specific
speed or duplex mode. Your link partner must match the setting you choose.
1 Gbps speeds and higher cannot be forced. Use the autonegotiation
advertising setting to manually set devices for 1 Gbps and higher.


Speed, duplex, and autonegotiation advertising are configured through
the ethtool* utility. ethtool is included with all versions of Red Hat
after Red Hat 7.2. For the latest version, download and install
ethtool from the following website:

   http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/software/network/ethtool/


Caution: Only experienced network administrators should force speed and
duplex or change autonegotiation advertising manually. The settings at
the switch must always match the adapter settings. Adapter performance
may suffer or your adapter may not operate if you configure the adapter
differently from your switch.

An Intel(R) Network Adapter using fiber-based connections, however, will not
attempt to auto-negotiate with its link partner since those adapters operate
only in full duplex and only at their native speed.


NOTE: For the Intel(R) Ethernet Connection X552 10 GbE SFP+ you must specify
the desired speed. 


MAC and VLAN anti-spoofing feature
----------------------------------

When a malicious driver attempts to send a spoofed packet, it is dropped by
the hardware and not transmitted.

An interrupt is sent to the PF driver notifying it of the spoof attempt.
When a spoofed packet is detected, the PF driver will send the following
message to the system log (displayed by the "dmesg" command):

ixgbe ethX: ixgbe_spoof_check: n spoofed packets detected
where "x" is the PF interface number; and "n" is number of spoofed packets.

NOTE: This feature can be disabled for a specific Virtual Function (VF).
ip link set <pf dev> vf <vf id> spoofchk {off|on}


IPRoute2 Tool for setting MAC address, VLAN and rate limit
----------------------------------------------------------

You can set a MAC address of a Virtual Function (VF), a default VLAN and the
rate limit using the IProute2 tool. Download the latest version of the
iproute2 tool from Sourceforge if your version does not have all the features
you require.


Wake on LAN Support (WoL)
-------------------------

Some adapters do not support Wake on LAN. To determine if your adapter
supports Wake on LAN, run
  ethtool ethX

The Intel(R) Ethernet Converged Network Adapter X550-T1 and Intel(R) Ethernet
Converged Network Adapter X550-T2 have a manageability/AUX power connector.
These devices only support WoL if AUX power is supplied via this connector.
Note that this is system and adapter specific. Some with this connector do not
support WoL. Some systems do not provide the correct power connection. See your
system documentation for details.


IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP) Hardware Clock (PHC)
------------------------------------------------------------

Precision Time Protocol (PTP) is used to synchronize clocks in a computer
network. PTP support varies among Intel devices that support this driver.
Use "ethtool -T <netdev name>" to get a definitive list of PTP capabilities
supported by the device.

IXGBE_PTP is a compile time flag. The user can enable it at compile time to add
support for PTP from the driver. The flag is used by editing the make file
as follows when it is being compiled:

>make CFLAGS_EXTRA="-DIXGBE_PTP" install


VXLAN Overlay HW Offloading
---------------------------

Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN) allows you to extend an L2 network over an L3
network, which may be useful in a virtualized or cloud environment. Some Intel(R)
Ethernet Network devices perform VXLAN processing, offloading it from the
operating system. This reduces CPU utilization.
 
VXLAN offloading is controlled by the tx and rx checksum offload options
provided by ethtool. That is, if tx checksum offload is enabled, and the
adapter has the capability, VXLAN offloading is also enabled.

Support for VXLAN and Geneve HW offloading is dependent on
kernel support of the HW offloading features.


VXLAN Overlay HW Offloading is enabled by default. To view and configure
VXLAN offload on a VXLAN-overlay offload enabled device, use the following
command:

  # ethtool -k ethX
   (This command displays the offloads and their current state.)

For more information on configuring your network for overlay HW offloading
support, refer to the Intel Technical Brief, "Creating Overlay Networks
Using Intel Ethernet Converged Network Adapters" (Intel Networking Division,
August 2013):

http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/technology-briefs/
overlay-networks-using-converged-network-adapters-brief.pdf


Virtual Function (VF) TX Rate Limit
-----------------------------------

Virtual Function (VF) TX rate limit is configured with an ip command from the
PF interface.
  # ip link set eth0 vf 0 rate 1000
    (This command sets TX Rate Limit of 1000Mbps for VF 0)

Note that the limit is set per queue and not for the entire VF interface.


================================================================================


Known Issues/Troubleshooting
----------------------------


MAC address of Virtual Function changes unexpectedly
----------------------------------------------------

If a Virtual Function's MAC address is not assigned in the host, then the
VF (virtual function) driver will use a random MAC address. This random MAC
address may change each time the VF driver is reloaded. You can assign a
static MAC address in the host machine. This static MAC address will survive
a VF driver reload.


Hardware Issues
---------------

For known hardware and troubleshooting issues, either refer to the "Release
Notes" in your User Guide, or for more detailed information, go to
http://www.intel.com.

In the search box enter your devices controller ID followed by "spec update"
(i.e., 82599 spec update). The specification update file has complete
information on known hardware issues.


Software Issues
---------------

NOTE: After installing the driver, if your Intel Ethernet Network Connection
is not working, verify that you have installed the correct driver.

Intel(R) Active Management Technology 2.0, 2.1, 2.5 Not Supported in
Conjunction with Linux driver.


MSI-X Issues with Kernels Between 2.6.19 - 2.6.21 (inclusive)
-------------------------------------------------------------

Kernel panics and instability may be observed on any MSI-X hardware if you use
irqbalance with kernels between 2.6.19 and 2.6.21. If such problems are
encountered, you may disable the irqbalance daemon or upgrade to a newer
kernel.


LRO and iSCSI Incompatibility
-----------------------------

LRO is incompatible with iSCSI target or initiator traffic. A panic may occur
when iSCSI traffic is received through the ixgbe driver with LRO enabled. To
workaround this, the driver should be built and installed with:
# make CFLAGS_EXTRA=-DIXGBE_NO_LRO install


Multiple Interfaces on Same Ethernet Broadcast Network
------------------------------------------------------

Due to the default ARP behavior on Linux, it is not possible to have one
system on two IP networks in the same Ethernet broadcast domain
(non-partitioned switch) behave as expected. All Ethernet interfaces will
respond to IP traffic for any IP address assigned to the system. This results
in unbalanced receive traffic.

If you have multiple interfaces in a server, either turn on ARP filtering by
entering:
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/arp_filter

This only works if your kernel's version is higher than 2.4.5.


NOTE: This setting is not saved across reboots. The configuration change can
be made permanent by adding the following line to the file /etc/sysctl.conf:
net.ipv4.conf.all.arp_filter = 1

Another alternative is to install the interfaces in separate broadcast domains
(either in different switches or in a switch partitioned to VLANs).


UDP Stress Test Dropped Packet Issue
------------------------------------

Under small packet UDP stress with the ixgbe driver, the system may
drop UDP packets due to socket buffers being full. Setting the driver Flow
Control variables to the minimum may resolve the issue. You may also try
increasing the kernel's default buffer sizes by changing the values in

  /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_default and rmem_max


Cisco Catalyst 4948-10GE port resets may cause switch to shut down ports
------------------------------------------------------------------------

82598-based hardware can re-establish link quickly and when connected to some
switches, rapid resets within the driver may cause the switch port to become
isolated due to "link flap". This is typically indicated by a yellow instead
of a green link light. Several operations may cause this problem, such as
repeatedly running ethtool commands that cause a reset.

A potential workaround is to use the Cisco IOS command "no errdisable detect
cause all" from the Global Configuration prompt which enables the switch to
keep the interfaces up, regardless of errors.


Rx Page Allocation Errors
-------------------------

'Page allocation failure. order:0' errors may occur under stress with kernels
2.6.25 and newer. This is caused by the way the Linux kernel reports this
stressed condition.



DCB: Generic segmentation offload on causes bandwidth allocation issues
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In order for DCB to work correctly, Generic Segmentation Offload (GSO), also
known as software TSO, must be disabled using ethtool. Since the hardware
supports TSO (hardware offload of segmentation), GSO will not be running by
default. The GSO state can be queried with ethtool using ethtool -k ethX.

When using 82598-based network connections, ixgbe driver only supports 16
queues on a platform with more than 16 cores.

Due to known hardware limitations, RSS can only filter in a maximum of 16
receive queues.

82599 and X540, and X550-based network connections support up to 64 queues.


Disable GRO when routing/bridging
---------------------------------

Due to a known kernel issue, GRO must be turned off when routing/bridging. GRO
can be turned off via ethtool.
ethtool -K ethX gro off

where ethX is the ethernet interface being modified.


Lower than expected performance
-------------------------------

Some PCIe x8 slots are actually configured as x4 slots. These slots have
insufficient bandwidth for full line rate with dual port and quad port
devices. In addition, if you put a PCIe Generation 3-capable adapter
into a PCIe Generation 2 slot, you cannot get full bandwidth. The driver
detects this situation and writes the following message in the system log:

"PCI-Express bandwidth available for this card is not sufficient for optimal
performance. For optimal performance a x8 PCI-Express slot is required."

If this error occurs, moving your adapter to a true PCIe Generation 3 x8 slot
 will resolve the issue.


ethtool may incorrectly display SFP+ fiber module as direct attached cable
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Due to kernel limitations, port type can only be correctly displayed on kernel
2.6.33 or greater.

Under Redhat 5.4, system may crash when closing guest OS window after
loading/unloading the Physical Function (PF) driver.

Do not remove the ixgbe driver from Dom0 while Virtual Functions (VFs) are
assigned to guests. VFs must first use the xm "pci-detach" command to hot-plug
the VF device out of the VM it is assigned to or else shut down the VM.

Unloading Physical Function (PF) driver may cause kernel panic or system
reboot when VM is running and VF is loaded on the VM.

On pre-3.2 Linux kernels, unloading the Physical Function (PF) driver causes
system reboots when the VM is running and VF is loaded on the VM.

Do not unload the PF driver (ixgbe) while VFs are assigned to guests.


Running ethtool -t ethX command causes break between PF and test client
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

When there are active VFs, "ethtool -t" will only run the link test. The
driver will also log in syslog that VFs should be shut down to run a full
diagnostic test.


SLES10 SP3 Random System Panic when Reloading Driver
----------------------------------------------------

This is a known SLES-10 SP3 issue. After requesting interrupts for MSI-X
vectors, system may panic.

Currently, the only known workaround is to build the driver with
CFLAGS_EXTRA=-DDISABLE_PCI_MSI if the driver needs to be loaded/unloaded.
Otherwise, the driver can be loaded once and will be safe, but unloading it
will lead to the issue.

Enabling SR-IOV in a 32-bit Microsoft* Windows* Server 2008 Guest OS Using
Intel? 82576-based GbE or Intel? 82599-based 10GbE Controller Under KVM
KVM Hypervisor/VMM supports direct assignment of a PCIe device to a VM. This
includes traditional PCIe devices, as well as SR-IOV-capable devices using
Intel 82576-based and 82599-based controllers.

While direct assignment of a PCIe device or an SR-IOV Virtual Function (VF) to
a Linux-based VM running 2.6.32 or newer kernel is functional, there is a
known issue with Microsoft Windows Server 2008 VM that results in a "yellow
bang" error. This problem is within the KVM VMM itself, not the Intel driver
or the SR-IOV logic of the VMM. The KVM emulates an older CPU model for the
guests, and this older CPU model does not support MSI-X interrupts, which is a
requirement for Intel SR-IOV.

If you wish to use the Intel 82576- or 82599-based controllers in SR-IOV mode
with KVM and a Microsoft Windows Server 2008 guest, try the following
workaround. Configure KVM to emulate a different model of CPU
when using qemu to create the KVM guest:
"-cpu qemu64,model=13"


Unable to obtain DHCP lease on boot with RedHat
-----------------------------------------------

For configurations where the auto-negotiation process takes more than 5
seconds, the boot script may fail with the following message:
"ethX: failed. No link present. Check cable?"

If this error appears even though the presence of a link can be confirmed
using ethtool ethX, try setting "LINKDELAY=5" in
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ethX.

NOTE: Link time can take up to 30 seconds. Adjust LINKDELAY value accordingly.


Host May Reboot after Removing PF when VF is Active in Guest
------------------------------------------------------------

Using kernel versions earlier than 3.2, do not unload the PF driver with
active VFs. Doing this will cause your VFs to stop working until you reload
the PF driver and may cause a spontaneous reboot of your system.

Prior to unloading the PF driver, you must first ensure that all VFs are
no longer active. Do this by shutting down all VMs and unloading the VF driver.


Out of memory issues on IA32 systems
-------------------------------------

The driver may consume a lot of memory based on the number of CPUs and network
interfaces. This leads to memory segmentation. Thus, the driver may not be
able to allocate enough memory. To resolve this, reduce the number of
descriptors using ethtool -G or the number of queues through the RSS parameter.


VLAN tags are stripped on kernels earlier than 2.6.36
-----------------------------------------------------

In order to support DCB, kernels earlier than 2.6.36 strip VLAN tags for
VLAN0. This ensures connectivity using 802.1p frames between kernels that
have built-in support and kernels that do not.

If the VLAN tags are necessary AND DCB is NOT used, disable vlan stripping
on older kernels at build time with the following:

  # make CFLAGS_EXTRA=-DIXGBE_DISABLE_8021P_SUPPORT
